          "suggested_fix": "Audit the state management system. Check if progress data is being loaded from localStorage without validation. Add a state consistency check on app load that validates: (1) if lessons_completed === 0, then total_xp should be 0 and quiz_percent should be 0; (2) total_xp should equal sum of all lesson XP earned; (3) quiz_percent should only show if quiz has been started.
